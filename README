NAME

Alien::FFI - an Alien package for libffi

DESCRIPTION

This Alien package, built on Alien::Base, provides libffi, a foreign function
interface. I hope that this provides a base package for the forthcoming Ctypes
library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

The best place to get help for this module is to file Issues on github:

    http://github.com/run4flat/Alien-FFI/issues

Mostly, I don't expect that you'll want to use this module directly, but
should look into Ctypes:

    http://gitorious.org/perl-ctypes

or, for a currently working project based on FFCall, see FFI:
